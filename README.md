# Requirements 
Please have python installed and git
And run ,

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Xyla-mui/Test_1_semister_1
```

# running 

First **cd** into the directory 
```shell
cd ./Test_1_semister_1
```

Then on windows 
```powershell
py .\test1.py
```
On Linux 
```bash
python3 ./test1.py
```
# some notes

# interpreter 
An interpreter executes source code without compilation to machine code ( a binary).
They is usual an intermediate form like **byte code** or other formats.

> Note interpretors have performance overhead coming from the interpreter it's self this is why many interpreted languages are slower than there compiled counterparts 

Examples of interpreted languages include 
**Python**,**php**,**ruby**

# compilers
A compiler converts source code (instructions ) to machine code(binary), the compilers mostly work the same way converting object code (.obj) to machine code(".exe",".dpkg", ".apk", ."ipa", ".elf")

Examples of compiled languages
C, C++, C# ,JAVA ,GO, RUST ,ZIG ,OLDIN

# Text editors
Text editor are programs used to edit the text in files.
E.g notepad
# code editors 
Code editors are text editor specifically meant for editing text that is code they usually come with syntax highlights, auto completion and language detection 
E.g sublime, vim ,neovim, vscode 
# IDE 
Integrate development environment are tools that let you develop, debug and deploy in the same program 
E.g jet brains idea( like, Rider, intellij idea, pycharm, go lang , visual studio )
# IDLE
is an interactive shell utility that let's you write code and run it automatically from the code line

# what python is 
Python is an **interpreted**  language influenced majorly by the language ABC ,
Python was developed with a goal to make programming as accessible as possible to everyone hence why it's syntax looks like English although slow it allows for rapid ***prototyping*** 

# Features 
### advantages 
1. Easy prototyping 
2. Dynamic type checking 
3. Readable 
### disadvantages
1. Too slow often requires help from other languages 
2. Readability at the expense of expressiveness 
3. Loss of fine grained control
